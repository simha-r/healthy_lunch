== README



- To deploy the environment variables from config/application.yml to heroku, use this command:

   figaro heroku:set -e production -a shrouded-savannah-3845

- When you update a static image with the same name, beware of cloudinary. It might not recognize the new image.


- On updating a static image, always run this command locally:(NOT ON HEROKU I THINK)

   rake cloudinary:sync_static
